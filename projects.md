These are some of the projects I have worked on during the years:

## [XML Driven Logon Script](/projects/xml-driven-logon-script/) ##
The *XML Driven Logon Script* is an VBScript based logon script which behaviour (like mapping network drives, installing printers) is controlled from an xml file. This makes it easy for the none-programmer to build and manage logon scripts within his or hers organisation, since no knowledge of VBScript is needed.S ee more: [XML Driven Logon Script](/projects/xml-driven-logon-script/).
