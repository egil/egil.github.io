These are some of the projects I have worked on during the years:

## [bUnit](https://bunit.dev)
A testing library for Blazor Components. You can easily define components under test in C# or Razor syntax and verify outcome using semantic HTML diffing/comparison logic. You can easily interact with and inspect components, trigger event handlers, provide cascading values, inject services, mock IJSRuntime, and perform snapshot testing.

## [AngleSharp Diffing](https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp.Diffing)
A semantic diffing/comparision library for HTML. Builds on AngleSharp and makes it possible to compare two AngleSharp node lists and get a list of differences between them.

## [uVis.web](/projects/uvis-web/) ##
This was my thesis project, done at the IT University of Copenhagen. See more: [uVis.web](/projects/uvis-web/)

## [Inversion of Block Tridiagonal Matrices](/projects/inversion-of-block-tridiagonal-matrices/) ##
The bachelor thesis from 2010 I did in collaboration with Rasmus Koefoed Jakobsen. See more: [Inversion of Block Tridiagonal Matrices](/projects/inversion-of-block-tridiagonal-matrices/)

## [XML Driven Logon Script](/projects/xml-driven-logon-script/) ##
The *XML Driven Logon Script* is an VBScript based logon script which behaviour (like mapping network drives, installing printers) is controlled from an xml file. This makes it easy for the none-programmer to build and manage logon scripts within his or hers organisation, since no knowledge of VBScript is needed.See more: [XML Driven Logon Script](/projects/xml-driven-logon-script/).
