With the Windows Phone 7.8 update to my Nokia Lumia 800, Nokia suddenly decided that my hearing is precious and I am not able to take care of it myself... the [volume is now capped at half of what it was before](http://www.phonearena.com/news/Windows-Phone-7.8-update-causing-volume-problems-with-the-Nokia-Lumia-800_id39451).

I have been using the earbuds that came with the phone. They are quite good, they do not block out all of the sound from the surroundings, and since I mostly listen to podcasts or audiobooks when travelling around the city, I always had the volume at 30 (the maximum) to be able to hear what is being said. Now I have to use earbuds that are much more uncomfortable to hear anything over the city noise.

It might be too much to ask to get both the new tile sizes and the volume I am used to, but I am going to take the chance anyway and say **Nokia, please turn my f...ing volume back up again**. It is after all [just a registry setting...](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2052653#4)
