It is not often I find myself struck by the passing of a public figure, but with Steve Jobs it is hard not to feel touched. The man who has had such a great influence on the tech industry and the world in general, leaves us with a large collection of important innovations and ideas, that will continue to inspire for many years to come.

I will leave you with this fantastic quote from his [Stanford Commencement Address in 2005](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html).

> (http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html) "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart." -- Steve Jobs
